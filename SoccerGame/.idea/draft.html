    My last trip was to Sanibel, Florida with my family for the fourth of July. We used to go every single summer when I was little, but this was the first time we have been back in about 10 years. Sanibel has some of the best shells in Florida so I had a great time walking on the beach looking for shells and enjoying the ocean.
