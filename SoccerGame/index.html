    In order to be able to shoot on the cookie monster, you need to put 3 cookies
    in the cookie jar. In order to get a cookie in the cookie jar, you have to answer
    a math question right and then click on the cookie jar. Once you answer 3 questions
    right, you will see the cookie appear on the penalty spot. Then, you will be able
    to click on one of the numbers (1,2,3,4,5) in order to place your shot. If you score,
    you get a point. If the cookie monster saves it, he gets a point.
